# TDD-with-RSpec-
TDD with RSpec Completed - Prerequisite learning

By including:   require 'rspec/autorun'   at the start of the file we can access the RSpec module and all its facilities.
- autorun allows us to have our production code and testing code within the same file.
- to run, within a terminal navigate to the local directory where your files are kept (Rspec_Work) and run the file as normal, ie: spec_calculator.rb
- terminal output shows us how many tests are passing/failing.
